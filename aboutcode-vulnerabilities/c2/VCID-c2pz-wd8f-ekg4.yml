aliases:
  - CVE-2013-7377
summary: |
  Potential Command Injection
  When the ffprobe functionality is enabled on the server, HTTP POST requests can be made to /probe. These requests are passed to the ffprobe binary on the server. Through this HTTP endpoint it is possible to send a malformed source file name to ffprobe that results in arbitrary command execution.

  ### Mitigating Factors:
  The ffprobe functionality is not enabled by default. In addition, exploitation opportunities are limited in a standard configuration because the server binds to the local interface by default.
