aliases:
  - CVE-2016-1000229
summary: |
  XSS in key names
  Swagger is a standardized library for documenting API endpoints and their parameters.  Swagger uses a JSON document to organize API endpoint parameter data.

  Swagger-ui contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the key names for the following object path in the JSON document:
  ```
   .definitions.<USER_DEFINED>.properties.<INJECTABLE_KEY_NAME>
  ```
  Supplying a key name with script tags causes arbitrary code execution.  In addition it is possible to load the arbitrary JSON files remotely via the `URL` query-string parameter.

  This advisory is being disclosed before a public patched release is available because of a public Github issue documenting the vulnerability.
