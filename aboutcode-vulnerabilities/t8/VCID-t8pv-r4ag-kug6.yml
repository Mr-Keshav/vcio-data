summary: |
  XSS Filter Bypass via Encoded URL
  The validator module for Node.js contains functionality meant to filter potential XSS attacks (a filter called xss). A method of
  bypassing the filter via an encoded URL has been publicly disclosed. In general, because the functionâ€™s filtering is blacklist-based it is likely that other bypasses will be discovered in the future. Developers are encouraged not to use the xss filter function in this package.

  ### Details:
  The xss() function removes the word "javascript" when contained inside an attribute. However, it does not properly handle cases where
  characters have been hex-encoded. As a result, it is possible to build an input that bypasses the filter but which the browser will accept as valid JavaScript.

  For example, browsers interpret `<a href="jav&#x61;script:...">abc</a>` as `<a href="javascript:...">abc</a>`.
