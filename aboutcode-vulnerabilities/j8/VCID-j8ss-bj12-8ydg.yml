  XSS in client rendered block templates
  Rendr-handlebars is a library that allows the handlebars templating engine to be used with Rendr framework projects.  The templating can occur either on the client or the server.

  Versions up to 1.1.3 have a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when rendered inside a `_block` during client side rendering. Server side rendering is not affected and is properly escaped.
